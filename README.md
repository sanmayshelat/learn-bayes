Compare the impact of optional stopping in Bayesian versus Frequentist A/B testing.

Simulates experiments of known impact and calculates errors rates.

### Prior assumptions considered
- Uninformed priors
- Informed priors
- Correlated priors

### Optional stopping conditions considered
- Minimum wait time before optional stopping
- Frequency of checking results for optional stopping

### Results
- A/A test: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16S7TTwMBz8a5A3EwUuyiMWtpX23PIt3ltdN3fkF5820/edit?gid=0#gid=0
